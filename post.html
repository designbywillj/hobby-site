                            It's no secret at this point that if you're willing
                            to wait a few months after a AAA game's release,
                            you'll probably be able to find it for $10 to $20
                            cheaper (and sometimes even more). That waiting
                            period has seemed to shrink as this console
                            generation comes to a close, and if you held off on
                            buying Doom Eternal for that reason, you're in luck.
                            Just one month after its release, Doom Eternal's PC
                            version is currently selling for $40 at Walmart.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Unfortunately, this is a box that'll be shipped to
                            you with the code inside, but if you've already
                            waited this long to check out Doom Eternal, you may
                            not mind waiting a bit longer. The purchase includes
                            free shipping, and for me, the listing guarantees
                            delivery by April 27.

                        <p>
                            For comparison, Doom Eternal is full price on Amazon
                            and Steam. You can find it for $52.79 on Fanatical,
                            which will email you the digital code directly, but
                            if you're holding out for the best price, Walmart's
                            discount is the way to go.

                            Released March 20, Doom Eternal is the direct sequel
                            to Doom (2016). Players once again take control of
                            the Doom Slayer to battle the demonic forces of
                            Hell. The first-person shooter introduces new guns
                            as well as fresh platforming mechanics like
                            wall-climbing and swinging from bars, and it earned
                            an 8/10 in GameSpot's Doom Eternal review for its
                            calculated combat, well-designed arenas, inventive
                            demon-controlling mechanic in Battlemode, and more.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            "Though it can take a bit to get the hang of it, the
                            intricacies of Doom Eternal's combat, combined with
                            its enhanced mobility and option-heavy level design,
                            create a ton of white-knuckle moments that elevate
                            everything that made Doom 2016 work so well," wrote
                            editor Phil Hornshaw. "Its combat is just as quick
                            and chaotic, but requires you to constantly analyze
                            everything that's happening in order to come out
                            victorious. Once you get the hang of the rhythm of
                            Doom Eternal, it'll make you feel like a
                            demon-slaying savant."
